a.Bug 1:
I found a bug in the isValid() method.  My edge assertion tests on the hours show that there is a bug in the isValid() method but specifically in the checking hours part of the function.  I put in valid hours and it returns that the appointment is not valid when it should be.  This can be seen in my ApptTest file in the methods testConstructor(), and testApptData().  Both of these methods provide valid hours and assert that the appointment should be valid, however, these tests fail as the isValid() method is bugged where it says that the hours can be no greater than 12 in a day rather than 24.  This bug is also found in the testGetApptRange() method of TimeTableTest where it expects to find one appointment in the given range, but that appointment is not listed as valid so it doesn’t actually find that one appointment.
b.Bug 2:
I found a bug in the GetApptOccurrences() method of TimeTable.  I have five test methods that found the bug in this method.  Each method tests varying recurrences and other such differences to see how many appointments are in that range, however, every time the getApptOccurrences() method returns no more occurrences.  Looking at my tests and the code I found that it always checks to see if the occurrence day is before the last day (it should be checking if it is not, it is missing an !) and therefore always returns an empty list (which holds nothing and that is why my tests always get zero).
c.Bug 3:
I found a bug in the addAppt() method of CalDay.  My tests attempt to add an appointment to the calendar day using addAppt() in CalDay, however, my tests return an error.  This error is due to the fact that the for loop extends past where memory is allocated and causes a fault, and thus an error in the test suite.  The error when looking at the code is due to the changing of the conditional in the for loop from < to <= and therefore extending past the range of the list.
